    <title>The Decemberists- Everything I Try to Do, Nothing Seems to Turn Out Right</title>
</head>
<body>
The film was a bust, but we stayed to the ending<br>
Hair all a mussed but your clothes didn't look so bad<br><br>
And back on the street, the rain was descending<br>
In cold dirty sheets, so under the awning we sat<br>
And then you hailed yourself a yellow cab<br><br>
And I sat for a time by the valets in line<br>
And I read what you wrote on the card<br>
Above a cowboy you drew a big dark balloon<br>
Saying "try not to take it so hard"<br><br>
But there's this nagging suspicion that won't leave me alone tonight<br>
Its just that everything I try to do, nothing seems to turn out right<br><br>
We laid on our backs and stared at the ceiling<br>
Messed with your slacks, but ended up just holding your hand<br><br>
The rain will remain, the tv was telling<br>
A drip of the drain as your legs lifted brilliantly bent<br>
And fall to resting on the ottoman<br><br>
So we turned off the tube and we crawled to your room<br>
Leaving discarded clothes in our way<br>
And we both had some fun, though I twice bit my tongue<br>
And it lasted too long for my taste<br><br>
And there's this nagging suspicion that won't leave me alone tonight<br>
It's just that everything I try to do, nothing seems to turn out right<br><br>
And there's this nagging suspicion that won't leave me alone tonight<br>
It's just that everything I try to do, nothing seems to turn out right<br><br>
A wink and a wave and your off to your family's<br>
I sit and watch as the taxis lights distantly fade<br>
I guess I always thought it'd end this way...<br>
